**Title:** Forward modeling Hinode/EIS and XRT observations for varying heating frequency and active region age

## Abstract

In order to better understand heating mechanisms within active regions, it is important to examine the connection between heating processes on individual elemental strands within an active region and the large-scale magnetic evolution of the active region.
In particular, it is not widely understood how active region age is connected to heating frequency, the timescale on which energy release occurs on a given strand.
In order to address this question, we perform a series of field extrapolations at different periods during the lifetime of a typical active region, including over multiple rotations.
For these different extrapolations, we perform a series of hydrodynamic simulations using the HYDRAD field-aligned hydrodynamic code for a number of different heating frequencies.
We use these simulations to forward model time-dependent maps of intensity across the active region as observed by Hinode/EIS, XRT, and SDO/AIA.
From these simulated images, we construct maps of the differential emission measure distribution and the time lag (using pairs of AIA channels).
We then analyze correlations between these forward-modeled observables and active region age across multiple heating frequencies.
Comparisons will also be made to observations of these same active regions.
